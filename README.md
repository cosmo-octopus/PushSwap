# Push_Swap

The **Push_Swap** project aims to sort a set of integers using a specific set of instructions on two stacks. This program generates a sequence of push_swap instructions to achieve the desired sorting.

## Instruction Set

The following instructions are utilized for sorting:

Code | Instruction | Action
---- | ----------- | ------
sa   | swap a      | Swaps the top 2 elements of stack a
sb   | swap b      | Swaps the top 2 elements of stack b
ss   | swap a + swap b | Performs both sa and sb
pa   | push a      | Moves the top element of stack b to the top of stack a
pb   | push b      | Moves the top element of stack a to the top of stack b
ra   | rotate a    | Shifts all stack a elements from bottom to top
rb   | rotate b    | Shifts all stack b elements from bottom to top
rr   | rotate a + rotate b | Performs both ra and rb
rra  | reverse rotate a | Shifts all stack a elements from top to bottom
rrb  | reverse rotate b | Shifts all stack b elements from top to bottom
rrr  | reverse rotate a + reverse rotate b | Performs both rra and rrb

## Algorithm

For stacks with a size less than 6, a simple sorting method is employed (found in the `src` folder).

The primary algorithm used is **Radix sort**. This efficient algorithm sorts non-negative integers with a time complexity of O(n). It operates by distributing numbers into "boxes" based on their digits and then rearranging them based on the box order.

- Sort starts from the least significant digit.
- Each number is placed in the box corresponding to its digit.
- Numbers are then connected in order of the boxes.

This process is repeated for each digit, resulting in a fully sorted array.

## Algorithm Performance

The push_swap algorithm achieves:

- 3 numbers sorted in a maximum of 3 instructions
- 4 numbers sorted in a maximum of 7 instructions
- 5 numbers sorted in a maximum of 11 instructions
- 100 numbers sorted in a maximum of 1084 instructions (3 points)
- 500 numbers sorted in a maximum of 6785 instructions (4 points)

The algorithm is sufficient for project requirements and can exceed 105% with bonus completion.

## Bonus

The bonus task involves writing a program named **checker** that takes stack A as an argument (formatted as a list of integers). Checker reads instructions from standard input, executes them on the stack, and then verifies the sorting.

- If stack A is sorted and stack B is empty, checker displays "OK."
- Otherwise, it displays "KO."
- Invalid arguments result in an "Error" message.
